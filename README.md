# ping-pong-table-status
Is the ping-pong table available?


### What's this? ###

This is the front end of a project we used to run in the office on a spare monitor and two Raspberry Pis to tell (using motion sensors) if the ping-pong table (which was on the other side of the building) was currently in use.
